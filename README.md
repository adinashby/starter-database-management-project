# Database Management - Project

This template repository is the starter project for Database Management Project. Written in Access.

### Question(s)

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the final project for your Microsoft Access course, with the three deliverables:

### Deliverable 0: Project Proposal (Initial Setup)
**Objective:** Define the problem domain and specify the database application.
- **Instructions:** 
  - Select a small business scenario (e.g., managing a bookstore, inventory system, student records, etc.).
  - Write a 1-2 page proposal outlining the purpose of the database, the key functionalities, and what the database should track (e.g., customers, products, sales, employees).
  - Identify the types of reports the business would need (e.g., monthly sales, customer orders, etc.).
  - Include a list of at least 4 entities (such as Customers, Orders, Products, and Employees) that the database will contain.

**Deliverables:**
  - A written proposal document (Word or PDF).
  - A rough entity-relationship (ER) diagram (can be hand-drawn or done using software like Lucidchart or draw.io).

### Deliverable 1: Building the Database (Tables, Queries, Forms, Reports)
**Objective:** Create the foundation of the database, including tables and relationships, queries, forms, and simple reports.
- **Instructions:**
  - **Tables:**
    - Create tables for the identified entities from Deliverable 0. Ensure you include relevant fields, use appropriate data types, and define primary keys.
    - Include relationships between the tables, and establish **foreign keys** where needed to maintain referential integrity (e.g., link Customers to Orders).
  
  - **Queries:**
    - Write at least three queries to extract relevant information (e.g., a query to list all customer orders, a query to find products that are low in stock, etc.).
  
  - **Forms:**
    - Create simple data entry forms for at least two of your tables (e.g., an Order Entry Form for entering new orders, or a Customer Information Form).
  
  - **Reports:**
    - Generate one simple report based on your queries (e.g., a report showing a list of orders, or a list of customers who have placed orders in the last 30 days).
    
**Deliverables:**
  - A fully functional Access database file (.accdb) with:
    - At least 4 tables with primary and foreign keys established.
    - 3 queries that display meaningful information.
    - 2 forms for data entry.
    - 1 simple report generated from a query.

---

### Deliverable 2: Advanced Reporting, Macros, and Basic Automation
**Objective:** Enhance the database with advanced reports, simple macros, and basic automation using Access VBA.
- **Instructions:**
  - **Reports with Groups and Calculated Fields:**
    - Create a report that groups data (e.g., grouping sales by customer or date) and includes at least one calculated field (e.g., calculating total sales or the average order value).
  
  - **Simple Macros:**
    - Design at least two simple macros to automate tasks. For example, a macro to automatically open a specific form or generate a report with a button click.
  
  - **Access VBA:**
    - Write very basic VBA code (for non-programmers) to enhance functionality. This could be as simple as displaying a message box when a button is clicked or automating a form field based on user input.
  
**Deliverables:**
  - An enhanced Access database file (.accdb) containing:
    - 1 advanced report with grouping and a calculated field.
    - 2 simple macros to automate tasks.
    - 1 small piece of VBA code to demonstrate basic automation (e.g., a message box or calculated control on a form).
